# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Pneumonia-detection
This project explores the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification, with a focus on three distinct architectures. Using the Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset, we compare the modelsâ€™ performance in detecting pneumonia, providing insights into their strengths and applicability to healthcare diagnostics.
